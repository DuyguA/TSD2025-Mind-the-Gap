The kimono (着物) is the national costume of <GPE>Japan</GPE>. Originally the word kimono literally meant thing to wear (ki wearing and mono thing ) but now has come to denote a particular type of traditional full-length <NORP>Japanese</NORP> garment. The standard plural of the word kimono in <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> is kimonos [ <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> ], but the unmarked <NORP>Japanese</NORP> plural kimono is also sometimes found. Kimonos are T-shaped, straight-lined robes that fall to the ankle, with collars and wide, full-length sleeves. Kimonos are wrapped around the body, always with the left side over the right (except when dressing the dead for burial) and secured by a wide belt called an obi, which is usually tied at the back. Kimonos are generally worn with traditional footwear (especially zōri or geta) and split-toe socks (tabi). <DATE>Today</DATE>, kimonos are most often worn by women, and on special occasions. Traditionally, unmarried women wore a style of kimono called furisode, which have floor-length sleeves, on special occasions. A few older women and even fewer men still wear the kimono on a daily basis. Men wear the kimono most often at weddings, tea ceremonies, and other very special or very formal occasions. Professional sumo wrestlers are often seen in the kimono because they are required to wear traditional <NORP>Japanese</NORP> dress whenever appearing in public. They commonly wear the kind of casual <NORP>Japanese</NORP> attire that is referred to as yukata, which is of plain unlined cotton. <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> History <CARDINAL>2</CARDINAL> Textiles <CARDINAL>3</CARDINAL> Cost <CARDINAL>4</CARDINAL> Styles <CARDINAL>5</CARDINAL> Kimono accessories and related garments <CARDINAL>6</CARDINAL> Care of Kimonos <NUMERIC>7</NUMERIC> See also <CARDINAL>8</CARDINAL> References <CARDINAL>9</CARDINAL> External links <CARDINAL>2.1</CARDINAL> Parts of a woman s kimono <CARDINAL>4.1</CARDINAL> Women s <PRODUCT>Kimonos</PRODUCT> <CARDINAL>4.2</CARDINAL> Men s <PRODUCT>Kimonos</PRODUCT> <CARDINAL>4.1.1</CARDINAL> <ORG>Kurotomesode</ORG> <NUMERIC>4.1.2</NUMERIC> <ORG>Furisode</ORG> <NUMERIC>4.1.3</NUMERIC> <ORG>Irotomesode</ORG> <NUMERIC>4.1.4</NUMERIC> <PERSON>Homongi</PERSON> <NUMERIC>4.1.5</NUMERIC> <PERSON>Tsukesage</PERSON> <NUMERIC>4.1.6</NUMERIC> <PERSON>Iromuji</PERSON> <NUMERIC>4.1.7</NUMERIC> <PERSON>Komon</PERSON> <NUMERIC>4.1.8</NUMERIC> Edo Komon <NUMERIC>4.1.9</NUMERIC> <PERSON>Uchikake</PERSON> <NUMERIC>4.1.10</NUMERIC> Susohiki / Hikizuri <NUMERIC>5.1</NUMERIC> <PERSON>Hiyoku</PERSON> <NUMERIC>5.2</NUMERIC> Layering As the kimono has another name gofuku (呉服, literally clothes of Wu (呉) ), the earliest kimonos were heavily influenced by traditional <NORP>Han</NORP> <NORP>Chinese</NORP> clothing, known <DATE>today</DATE> as hanfu (漢服, kanfuku in <NORP>Japanese</NORP>), through <NORP>Japanese</NORP> embassies to <GPE>China</GPE> which resulted in extensive <NORP>Chinese</NORP> culture adoptions by <GPE>Japan</GPE>, as early as <DATE>the fifth century ce</DATE> It was during <DATE>the 8th century</DATE>, however, when <NORP>Chinese</NORP> fashions came into style among the <NORP>Japanese</NORP>, and the overlapping collar became particularly a women s fashion During Japan s <DATE>Heian period (794 – 1192 ce</DATE>), the kimono became increaslingly stylized, though one still wore a half-apron, called a mo, over it During <DATE>the Muromachi age (1392-1573</DATE>), the Kosode, a single kimono formerly considered underwear, began to be worn without the hakama pants over it, and thus began to be held closed by an obi belt During <DATE>the Edo period</DATE> (<DATE>1603-1867</DATE>), the sleeves began to grow in length, especially among unmarried women, and the Obi became wider, with various styles of tying coming into fashion Since then, the basic shape of both the men s and women s kimono has remained essentially unchanged. <PERSON>David Bowie</PERSON> made it a fashion statement on stage in <DATE>1972</DATE> with his <PERSON>Ziggy Stardust</PERSON> character. Kimonos made with exceptional skill from fine materials have been regarded as great works of art. Kimonos for men are available in various sizes, but kimonos for women are typically of a similar, larger size and are adjusted to body size by tucking and folding. An ideally tailored kimono has sleeves that end at the wrist when the arms are lowered. Men s kimonos should fall approximately to the ankle without tucking. A woman s kimono is longer to allow for the ohashori, the tuck that can be seen under the obi. Kimonos are made from a single bolt of fabric called a tan. Bolts come in standard dimensions — <QUANTITY>about 14 inches</QUANTITY> wide and <QUANTITY>12½ yards</QUANTITY> long – and the entire fabric is used to make one kimono. The finished kimono consists of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> main strips of fabric – <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> panels covering the body and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> panels forming the sleeves – with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panel and collar Historically, kimonos were often taken apart for washing as separate panels and resewn by hand. Because the entire bolt remains in the finished garment without cutting, the kimono can be retailored easily to fit a different person. The maximum length of the sleeve is dictated by the width of the fabric. The distance from the center of the spine to the end of the sleeve could not exceed twice the width of the fabric. Traditional kimono fabric was typically <QUANTITY>no more than 36 centimeters (14 inches</QUANTITY>) wide. Thus the distance from spine to wrist could not exceed a maximum of <QUANTITY>roughly 68 centimeters (27 inches</QUANTITY>). Modern kimono fabric is woven <QUANTITY>as wide as 42 centimeters</QUANTITY> (<QUANTITY>17 inches</QUANTITY>) to accommodate modern <NORP>Japanese</NORP> body sizes. Very tall or heavy people, such as sumo wrestlers, must have kimono custom-made by either joining multiple bolts of fabric together or weaving custom-width fabric. source Traditional kimonos are sewn by hand, and their fabrics are also frequently hand made and hand decorated. Various techniques such as yūzen dye resist are used for applying decoration and patterns to the base cloth. Repeating patterns that cover a large area of a kimono are traditionally done with the yūzen resist technique and a stencil. Over time there have been many variations in color, fabric and style, as well as accessories such as the obi. The kimono and obi are traditionally made of silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as rinzu). Modern kimonos are also widely available in less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton sateen, cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers. Silk is still considered the ideal fabric, however, and is a must for formal occasions. Customarily, woven patterns and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal; Formal kimonos have free-style designs dyed over the whole surface or along the hem During <DATE>the Heian period</DATE>, kimonos were worn with up to a dozen or more colorful contrasting layers, with each combination of colors being a named pattern <DATE>Today</DATE>, the kimono is normally worn with a single layer on top of a slip style undergarment. The pattern of the kimono can also determine in what season it should be worn. For example, a pattern with butterflies or cherry blossoms would be worn in <DATE>spring</DATE>. Watery designs are common during <DATE>the summer</DATE>. A popular autumn motif is the russet leaf of the <NORP>Japanese</NORP> maple; for <DATE>winter</DATE>, designs may include bamboo, pine trees and plum blossoms. Old kimonos are often recycled in various ways: altered to make haori, hiyoku, or kimonos for children, used to patch similar kimono, used for making handbags and similar kimono accessories, and used to make covers, bags or cases for various implements, especially for sweet-picks used in tea ceremonies. Kimonos with damage below the waistline can also be worn under a hakama to hide the damage. Historically, skilled craftsmen laboriously picked the silk thread from old kimono and rewove it into a new textile in the width of a heko obi for men s kimonoa, using a recycling weaving method called saki-ori. <PERSON>Doura Eri</PERSON> 衿 <PERSON>Fuki Furi Maemigoro</PERSON> 前身頃 Miyatsukuchi Okumi 衽 Sode 袖 <PERSON>Sodeguchi</PERSON> 袖口 <PERSON>Sodetsuke</PERSON> 袖付 <PERSON>Susomawashi</PERSON> 裾回し <PERSON>Tamoto</PERSON> 袂 <PERSON>Tomoeri</PERSON> 共衿 <PERSON>Uraeri</PERSON> 裏襟 <PERSON>Ushiromigoro</PERSON> kimino s are use for such things as weddings, and special celebration s like <EVENT>new years eve</EVENT> and <EVENT>new years</EVENT>. Kimonos can be expensive. A woman s kimono may easily exceed <NUMERIC>US$10,000</NUMERIC>; a complete kimono outfit, with kimono, undergarments, obi, ties, socks, sandals and accessories, can exceed <NUMERIC>US$20,000</NUMERIC>. A single obi may cost <MONEY>several thousand dollars</MONEY>. However, most kimonos owned by kimono hobbyists or by practitioners of traditional arts are far less expensive. Enterprising people make their own kimono and undergarments by following a standard pattern, or by recycling older kimonos. Cheaper and machine-made fabrics can substitute for the traditional hand-dyed silk. There is also a thriving business in <GPE>Japan</GPE> for second-hand kimonos, which can cost <MONEY>as little as ¥</MONEY> <MONEY>500</MONEY>. Women s obis, however, mostly remain an expensive item. Although simple patterned or plain colored ones can cost <MONEY>as low as ¥</MONEY> <MONEY>1,500</MONEY>, even a used obi can cost <MONEY>hundreds of dollars</MONEY>, and experienced craftsmanship is required to make them. Men s obis, even those made from silk, tend to be much less expensive, because they are narrower, shorter and less decorative than those worn by women. Kimonos range from extremely formal to casual. The level of formality of women s kimono is determined mostly by the pattern of the fabric, and color. Young women s kimonos have longer sleeves, signifying that they are not married, and tend to be more elaborate than similarly formal older women s kimono Men s kimonos are usually <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> basic shape and are mainly worn in subdued colors. Formality is also determined by the type and color of accessories, the fabric, and the number or absence of kamon (family crests), with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> crests signifying extreme formality Silk is the most desirable, and most formal, fabric. Kimonos made of fabrics such as cotton and polyester generally reflect a more casual style. Many modern <NORP>Japanese</NORP> women lack the skill to put on a kimono unaided: the typical woman s kimono consists of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> or more separate pieces that are worn, matched and secured in prescribed ways, and the assistance of licensed professional kimono dressers may be required. Called upon mostly for special occasions, kimono dressers both work out of hair salons and make house calls. Choosing an appropriate type of kimono requires knowledge of the garment s symbolism and subtle social messages, reflecting the woman s age, marital status, and the level of formality of the occasion. In contrast to women s kimono, men s kimono outfits are far simpler, typically consisting of a maximum of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> pieces, not including footwear. Men s kimonos have long sleeves which are attached to the body of the kimono with <QUANTITY>no more than a few inches</QUANTITY> unattached at the bottom, unlike the women s style of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the kimono. Men s sleeves are less deep than women s kimono sleeves to accommodate the obi around the waist beneath them, where as on a woman s kimono, the long, unattached bottom of the sleeve can hang over the obi without getting in the way. In <DATE>the modern era</DATE>, the principal distinctions between men s kimono are in the fabric. The typical kimono has a subdued, dark color; black, dark blues, greens, and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte. Some have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono. More casual kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors, such as lighter purples, greens and blues. <ORG>Sumo</ORG> wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors such as fuchsia. The most formal style of kimono is plain black with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> kamon on the chest, shoulders and back. Slightly less formal is the three-kamon kimono. These are usually paired with white undergarments and accessories. The Hiyoku is the floating lining or under-kimono traditionally worn under kimono. There are various meanings involved in Kimono-hiyoku-layering though mostly these are not used in everyday modern <NORP>Japanese</NORP> life. Often <DATE>today</DATE> instead of an entirely separate lining the Hiyoku refers to a lining sewn into the kimono itself. There are no special meanings ascribed to Hiyoku worn in this way. In modern day <GPE>Japan</GPE> the meanings of the layering of kimono and hiyoku are usually forgotten. Only maiko and geisha now use this layering technique for dances and subtle erotic suggestion usually emphasising the back of the neck. Modern <NORP>Japanese</NORP> brides may also wear a traditional <NORP>Shinto</NORP> kimono which is worn with a hiyoku. Traditionally kimonos were worn with hiyoku or floating linings. Hiyoku can be a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> kimono worn beneath the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and give the traditional layered look to the kimono. Often in modern kimonos the hiyoku is simply the name for the double sided lower-half of the kimono which may be exposed to other eyes depending on how the kimono is worn. Old-fashioned kimono styles meant that hiyoku were entire under-kimono, however <DATE>modern day</DATE> layers are usually only partial, to give the impression of layering. In the past, a kimono would often be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for wearing This traditional washing method is called arai hari. Because stitches must be taken out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. Arai hari is very expensive and difficult and is one of the causes of the declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments. A new custom-made kimono will be delivered to the customer with long, loose basting stitches placed around the outside edges [ citation needed ]. These stitches are called shituke ito. They are sometimes replaced for storage. They help to prevent bunching, folding and wrinkling, and keep the kimono s layers in alignment. Like many other traditional <NORP>Japanese</NORP> garments, there are specific ways to fold kimonos. These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored. Kimonos are often stored wrapped in paper. Kimonos need to be aired out at least seasonally and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono dry cleaned, although this can be extremely expensive, it is generally less expensive than arai hari and may be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes.
