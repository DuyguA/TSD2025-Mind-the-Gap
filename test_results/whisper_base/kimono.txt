Kimo no from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org. The Kimo no is the national costume of Japan. Originally the word Kimo no literally meant thing to wear, key, wearing, and mono thing, but now has come to denote a particular type of traditional full length Japanese garment. The The standard plural of the word kimono in English is kimonos, but the unmarked Japanese plural kimono is also sometimes found. that fall to the ankle with colors and wide full length sleeves. Kimonos are wrapped around the body,*| always with the left side over the right, except when dressing the dead for burial,*| and secured by a wide belt called an ovie, which is usually tied at the back.*| Kimonos are generally worn with traditional footwear, especially zori or or gaita and split-toed socks, tabi. Today, kimonos are often worn by women and on special occasions, traditionally unmarried women were a style of kimono called Fudi-sode, which have floor-length sleeves on special occasions. A few older women and even fewer men still wear the kimono on a daily basis.*| Men wear the kimono most often at weddings, tea ceremonies, and other very special or very formal*| occasions. Professional sumo wrestlers are often seen in the kimono because they are required to wear*| traditional Japanese dress whenever appearing in public. They commonly wear the kind of casual Japanese attire that is referred to as Yukata, which is of plain, online cotton.*| Section 1. History gofuku, literally, close of woe. The earliest kimonos were heavily influenced by the traditional Han Chinese clothing known today as Hanfu, Hanfu Kuhu in Japanese.*| Through Japanese embassies to China, which resulted in extensive Chinese cultural adoptions by Japan, as early as the 5th century of the common era. It was during the 8th century however when Chinese fashion came into style among the Japanese and the overlapping collar became particularly a woman's fashion. During Japanese pan period, 794-1192, the kimono became increasingly stylized, though one still wore a half apron called a moe over it during the Muromachi age. 1392-1573, the*| Kosode, a single kimono formerly considered underwear, began to be worn without the Hacama pants over it,*| and thus began to be held closed by an OV belt. During the Edo period, 1603 to 1867, the sleeves began to grow in length, especially among unmarried women, and the OB became wider with various styles of tying and coming into fashion.*| Since then, the basic shape of both the men's and women's kimono has remained essentially unchanged. David Bowie made it a fashion statement on stage in 1972 with his Ziggy*| Stardust character. Kimonos made with exceptional skill from fine materials have been regarded as great works of art.*| Section 2. Textiles. Kimonos for men are available in various sizes, but kimonos for women are typically of a similar, larger size,*| and are adjusted to the body size by tucking and folding. An ideally tailored kimono has*| sleeves that end at the wrist when the arms are lowered. Men's kimono should fall approximately*| to the ankle without tucking. A woman's kimono is longer to allow for the oha shori, the tuck*| that can be seen under the OB. Kimonos*| are made from a single bolt of fabric called a TAN. Bolts come in standard dimensions, about*| 14 inches wide, and 12.5 yards long, and the entire fabric is used to make one kimono.*| The finished kimono consists of four main strips of fabric, two panels covering the body, and two panels forming the sleeves, with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panel and collar.*| Historically, kimonos were often taken apart for washing as separate panels and re-sound by hand.*| Because the entire bolt remains in the finished garment without cutting, the kimono can be retailer easily to fit a different person.*| The maximum length of sleeve is dictated by the width of the fabric. The distance from the center of the spine to the end of the sleeve could not exceed twice the width of the fabric.*| Traditional kimono fabric was typically no more than 36 centimeters, 14 inches wide. Thus, the distance from spine to wrist could not exceed a maximum of roughly 68 centimeters or 27 inches. Modern kimono fabric is woven as wide as 42 centimeters, 17 inches, to accommodate modern Japanese body sizes. Very tall or heavy people,*| such as sumo wrestlers, must have kimono custom made by either joining multiple bolts of fabric*| together or weaving custom width fabric. Traditional kimonos are sewn by hand and their fabrics are also*| frequently handmade and hand decorated. Various techniques such as use and die, resist, are used for applying decoration and patterns to the base cloth. Repeating patterns that cover a large area of kimono are traditionally done with the use and resist technique and a stencil. Over time, there have been many variations in color, fabric and style as well*| as accessories such as the OB. The kimono and OB are traditionally made of silk, silk brocade,*| silk crepe, such as shimmed, and satin weaves, such as rinzu. Modern kimono are widely available*| unless expensive, easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton, cotton, polyester, and other synthetic fibers.*| Silk is still considered the ideal fabric, however, and is a must for formal occasions.*| Customarily, woven patterns and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal.*| Formal kimonos have freestyle designs dyed over the whole surface or along the hem.*| During the Hay and Period, kimonos were worn with up to a dozen or more colorful contrasting layers,*| with each combination of colors being a named pattern. Today the kimono is normally worn with*| a single layer on top of a slip-style undergarment. The pattern of the kimono can also determine in what season it should be worn. For example, a pattern with butterflies or cherry blossoms would be worn in spring. Watery designs are common during the summer. A popular autumn motif is the rustic leaf of the Japanese maple. For winter, designs may include bamboo, pine trees, and plum blossoms.*| Old kimonos are often recycled in various ways, altered to make howari, hiyoku, or kimono for children.*| Used to patch similar kimono, used to make handbags and similar kimono accessories,*| to make handbags and similar kimono accessories, and used to make covers, bags, or cases for various implements. Especially for sweet picks, used in tea ceremonies.*| Kimonos with damage below the waistline can also be worn under a hakama to hide the damage.*| Historically, skilled craftsmen laboriously picked the silk thread from old kimono and re-woven it into a new textile.

A complete kimono outfit with kimono, undergarments, OB, ties, socks, sandals, and accessories can exceed $20,000 US dollars. A single OB may cost several thousand dollars. However, most kimonos, owned by kimono hobbyists or by practitioners of traditional arts, are far less expensive.

Enterprising people make their own kimono outfit with kimono, undergarments, undergar or by practitioners of traditional arts, are far less expensive.*| Enterprising people make their own kimono and undergarments by following a standard pattern, or by recycling older kimonos.*| Cheaper and machine-made fabrics can substitute for the traditional hand-died silk.*| There is also a thriving business in Japan for second-hand kimonos, which can*| cost as little as 500 Japanese yen. Women's obis, however, mostly remain an expensive item. Although*| simple, patterned or plain colored ones can cost as low as a 1500 Japanese yen. Even a used*| obi can cost hundreds of dollars, and experience craftmanship is required to make them.*| Men's OBs, even those made from silk, tend to be much less expensive, because they are narrower, shorter, and less decorative than those worn by women.*| Section 4. Stiles styles. Kimonos range from extremely formal to casual. The level of formality of women's kimonos is determined mostly by the pattern of fabric and color. Young women's kimonos have longer sleeves, signifying that they are not married, and tend to be more elaborate than similarly formal, older women's kimonos. Men's kimonos are usually one basic shape and are mainly worn in*| subdued colors. Formality is also determined by the type and color of accessories, the fabric,*| and the number or absence of, come on, family crests, with five crests signifying extreme formality.*| Silk is the most desirable and most formal fabric. Chemonos made of fabric such as cotton and polyester generally reflect a more casual style.*| Section 4.1 Women's Chemonos Many modern Japanese women lack the skill to put on a chemono un-aided. The typical woman's kimono consists of 12 or more separate pieces*| that are worn, matched and secured in prescribed ways, and the assistance of licensed professional*| kimono dressers may be required. Called upon mostly for special occasions, kimono dressers*| both work out of hair salons and makehouse calls. Choosing an appropriate type of kimono requires*| knowledge of the garment symbolism*| and subtle social messages reflecting the woman's age, marital status, and the level of formality of*| the occasion. Section 4.1.1 Kuro tome sode A black kimono pattern only below the waistline is very*| popular and extremely polaroid. Kuro-toroko are the most formal*| kimono for married women. They are often worn by mothers at the bride and grooms at weddings.*| Kuro-toe-me-sode usually have five come-on printed on the sleeves, chest, and back of the kimono.*| Section 4.1.2. Fudisode. Fudisode literally translates as swinging sleeves. They are usually worn at coming of age ceremonies, Sai-jin-shiki, worn by married women usually close relatives of the bride and groom at weddingsmongi ranks slightly higher than their close relatives that Sukesage. Holmongi may be worn by both married and unmarried women. Often friends of the bragg will wear Homoongi at weddings and receptions. They may also be worn to formal parties.*| Section 4.1.5*| Tsukesage has more modest patterns that cover a small area, mainly below the waist, than the more formal homongi. They may also be worn by married women. Section 4.1.7, Cormon, Fine Pattern,*| Quimono with a small repeated pattern throughout the garment. This style is more casual and may be worn around town, or dressed up with a formal OB for a restaurant. Both married and unmarried women may wear a common. Section 4.1.8 Edo*| Komon is a type of common characterized by tiny dots arranged in dense patterns that form larger*| designs. The Edo Komon dyeing technique originated with the samurai class during the Edo period.*| The kimono with this type of pattern is of the same formality as a iro muji, and when decorated with a kamon, and a warn is visiting where, equivalent to a tsukesage or homonji.*| Uchi-ka-ke. Uchi-ka-ke is a highly formal kimono worn only by a bride or at a stage performance. The Uchi-ka-ke is heavily brocated and is supposed to be worn outside the actual kimono and ob as a sort of coat.*| One therefore never ties the obi around the Uchi-ka-ke. It is supposed to trail along the floor.*| This is also why it is heavily padded along the hem. The Uchiikake of the bridal costume is either white or very colorful, often with red as the base color.*| Section 4.1.10.*| Susohiki or Hikizuri.*| The susuhiki is mostly worn by geisha or by stage performers of the traditional Japanese dance. It is quite long compared to regular kimono, because the skirt is normally 1.5 to 1.6 meters or 4.7 to 5.2 feet long. A suzuhikiya can be up to 2 meters or 6.3 feet long.*| This is also why Gayshin Maikaf lift their kimono skirt when walking outside, also to show their beautiful under kimono or Nagajibon, see below.*| Section 4.2 Men's Kimonos In contrast to women's kimono, men's*| kimono outfits are far simpler, typically consisting of a maximum of five pieces, not including*| footwear. Men's kimonos have long sleeves which are attached to the body of the kimono, with*| no more than a few inches unattached at the bottom, unlike women's styles of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the kimono.*| Men's sleeves are less deep than women's kimono sleeves to accommodate the OB around the waist beneath them, whereas on a women's kimono the long unattached bottom of the sleeve can hang over the OB without getting in the way.*| In the modern era, the principal distinction between men's kimono are in the fabric.*| The typical kimono has subdued, dark color, black, dark blues, greens, and browns are common.*| Fabrics are usually matte.*| Some have a subtle pattern and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono. More casual*| kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors, such as lighter purples, greens, and blues.*| Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors, such as fuchsia.*| The most formal style of kimono is plain black, with five kimono on the chest, shoulders, and back.*| Slightly less formal is the three kimono, kimono, these are usually paired with white undergarments and accessories.*| Section 5. Kimono accessories and related garments. Nagajuban, or simply juban, are kimono-shaped robes worn by both men and women beneath the main outer garment.*| worn by both men and women beneath the main outer garment. Since sil kimono are delicate and difficult to clean, the Nagajibon helps to keep the outer kimono clean by preventing contact with the wearer's skin. Only the collar edge of the Nagajibon shows from beneath the outer kimono. Many Nagajibon have removable collars to allow them to be changed to match the outer garment and to be easily washed without washing the entire garment. While the most formal type of Naga Jibon are white,*| they are often as beautifully ornate and as patterned as the outer kimono. Since men's kimono*| are usually fairly subdued in pattern and color, the Naga Jibon allows for discreetly wearing*| very striking designs and colors. Hada Jiban, our thin*| garments similar to undershirts, they are worn by women under the Naga Jiban. Susu Yokai is a thin,*| heavy coat like garment worn by women under the Naga Jiban, sometimes the Susu Yoke and the hotajibon are combined into a one piece garment. Eri Sugata is a special color made for kimonos. Traditionally an undergarment is worn under the kimono, just the color of the undergarment shows. This undergarment, the jibon, can be very hot during summer weather, so the Eri Sugata was created. The Eri Sugata is just the collar of the undergarment. It is used to make the kimono more formal without the wear having to worry too much about having too many layers on or not on.*| Gaita are wooden sandals worn by men and women with Yukata. One unique style is worn solely by Gaysha. Hakama is a divided umanori, or undivided skirt,*| annon, which resembles a wide pair of pants, traditionally worn by men,*| but now also by women in less formal outfits,*| and is also worn in certain martial arts, such as aikido.*| A hakama typically has pleats, a koshiata, a stiff or padded part in the lower back of the wearer, and hemo, long lengths of fabric tied around the waist over the OB, described below. Hakuama are worn in several budo arts, such as Aikido, Kendo, Aeido, and Naginata. Hakuama are also worn by women at college graduation ceremonies and by Miko on Shinto Shrine. They can arrange from very formal to visiting where, depending on the pattern.*| Hauri is a hip or thigh length kimono jacket which adds formality. Hauri were originally reserved for men until fashion changed at the end of the Miji period. They are now worn by both men and women, though women's*| kimono jackets tend to be longer. Hauri Himo is a tassled woven string fastener for the*| Hauri. The most formal color is white. Hepti is a type of Hauri traditionally worn by*| shopkeepers and is now associated mostly with festivals. Han Ten is the workman's version of the gentleman's haurei, often padded for warmth as opposed to somewhat lighter happy.*| Yoku is a type of under kimono, historically worn by women beneath the kimono.*| Today, they are only worn on formal occasions such as weddings and other important social events.*| Kanzashi are hair ornaments worn by women in the*| coifiture hairstyle that often accompanies kimono. These may take the form of silk*| flowers, wooden combs, and jade hairpins. Obi and Obi is a sash worn with kimono by*| both men and women. Obi Ita is a thin fabric covered board placed under the Obi by women to keep its shape. It is also called a Mae Ita.*| Daktajimi is a thin sash worn around the Obi. This is usually now only used in more formal situations.*| This is also called a daktemaki. Koshihimo are thin sash is tied to keep the kimono in place while getting dressed and to keep it for moving during wear.*| Samue are the everyday clothes for a male Zen Buddhist monk and the favored garment for Shaka Hachi players.*| Tabi are ankle-high divided toe socks, usually warm zori or gaita.

The Hiyoku is the floating lining or under kimono traditionally worn under kimono.*| There are various meanings involved in kimono, Hiyoku layering, though mostly these are not*| used in everyday modern Japanese life. Often today instead of an entirely separate lining,*| the Hiyoku refers to a lining sewn into the kimono itself. There is no special meaning to describe to a hiyoku worn in this way. Section 5.2. Layering. In modern day Japan, the meanings of the layering of kimono and hiyoku are usually forgotten. Only Maiko and Gasha now use this layering technique for dances and subtle erotic suggestion, usually emphasizing the back of the neck. Modern Japanese brides may also wear*| traditional shinto kimono, which is worn with a hiyoku. Traditionally, kimonos were worn with hiyoku or*| floating linings. Hiyoku can be a second kimono worn beneath the first and give the traditional layered*| look to the kimono. Often in modern kimonos, the hiyoku is simply the name for the double-sided lower half of the kimono which may be exposed to others eyes depending on how the kimono is worn.*| Old-fashioned kimono styles meant that hiyoku were entirely under kimono. However modern-day layers are usually only partial to give the impression of layering. Section 6, care of kimonos. In the past, a kimono would often be entirely*| taken apart for washing, and then re-sown for wearing. This traditional washing method is called*| arai-hari. Because stitches must be taken out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand-sown.*| Arai-hari is very expensive and and difficult and is one of the causes of the*| declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that*| eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially*| for high-end garments. A new custom-made kimono will be delivered to the customer with long, loose, basting stitches, placed around the outside edges. These stitches are called Shi Tu Keito, and are sometimes replaced for storage. They help to prevent bunching, folding and wrinkling, and keep the kimonos layers in alignment. Like many other traditional Japanese garments, there are specific ways to fold*| kimonos. These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored.*| Kimonos are often stored wrapped in paper. Kimonos need to be erred out at least seasonally,*| and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono dry cleaned, although this*| can be extremely expensive. It is generally less expensive than Arai, Hati, and may be impossible*| for certain fabrics or dies.
